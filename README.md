1. If you haven't run the `reorganize_data.py` script, run it.
    + Just as a check, if you have all the files in test and train files, you're good

2. Run the `train_val_split.py` to get a train and validation split.
    + This will take 1/8th of the train data and put it into a different folder

3. Run all the cells in `hackathon.ipynb`, make sure the first training function is commented out

4. Enjoy the faster training and accuracy of this model lol
